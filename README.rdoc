== Alex Haas Portfolio

[LIVE] (http://www.alexchaas.com/)

http://www.alexchaas.com/ is a personal portfolio site used to showcase my recent works
as well as contact information.

It was built using the [Strata] (http://html5up.net/strata) template from [HTML5UP] (http://html5up.net/)
overlaid on a basic Ruby on Rails backend.

Rails was chosen to be used in order to integrate/host [Zombie Dinner] (http://www.alexchaas.com/arcade)
directly into my site as well as allow for further growth of more arcade games.
